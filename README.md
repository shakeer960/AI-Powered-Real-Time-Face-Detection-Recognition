# AI-Powered-Real-Time-Face-Detection-Recognition
AI-powered real-time facial detection and recognition system built with Python, OpenCV, CNN, and Dlib. Detects and recognizes multiple faces from live video streams or images, accurately identifying individuals across varying lighting, poses, and partial occlusions. Includes facial landmark detection.

# AI-Powered Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition

## üìå Overview
This project implements a **real-time facial detection and recognition system** powered by **Python, OpenCV, CNN, and Dlib**.  
It detects faces from live video streams or static images, identifies facial landmarks, and matches them against a trained dataset.  
The system is robust to **lighting variations**, **pose differences**, and **partial occlusions**.

## üöÄ Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection** using **Dlib's HOG** and **CNN models**.
- **Facial Landmark Detection** (68-point model).
- **Face Recognition** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.
- **High Accuracy** across diverse environments.
- **Support for Multiple Faces** in a single frame.
- **Dataset Flexibility** ‚Äì easily add or remove individuals.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, Dlib, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN)
- **Model:** Pre-trained CNN for feature extraction
- **Hardware:** Works with standard webcams or IP cameras
